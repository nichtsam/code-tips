# Clean Code
> My humble thoughts.

## What is Clean Code?
> Clean code is simple and direct.  
> Clean code reads like well-written prose.  
> Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

It’s not just code that works, it’s code that is easy to understand.  
Clean code should be intuitive instructions, not encrypted mystery.  

It should be
- **Readable and meaningful**
- **Easy to write and to maintain**
- **Intuitive**

And it should 
- **Reduce cognitive load**
