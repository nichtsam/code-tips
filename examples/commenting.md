## BAD

### Redundant

Wasting time.

```typescript
// Check if str contains 'w'
if (str.contains("w")) {
  // ...
}

let i = 0; // declare i
i++; // increment i
```

### Contradictory

function says it enrolls,  
comment says it get enrolled student.

so which is it? I will have to investigate...

```typescript
// get enrolled student
const enrollStudent = () => {
  // ...
};
```
